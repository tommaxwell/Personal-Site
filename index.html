<h1>Hi, I'm Tom!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my little piece of the web.</h2>

<p>Tom is an entrepreneur from Boulder, CO, creating new ways to discover content on the web. Previously he was on the advisory board of <a href = "http://www.lockerz.com">Lockerz.com</a>, a social commerce startup that rewards its users for sharing content from across the web. Tom has a strong business acumen, but studies computer science in his free-time. He codes mainly in front-end languages like JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and others. He's also somewhat of a nomad, so it's hard to catch him in one place for very long.
