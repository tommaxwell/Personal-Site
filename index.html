<h1>Hi, I'm Tom!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my little piece of the web.</h2>

<p>Hi, my name's Tom. I'm an entrepreneur from Boulder, CO, creating new ways to discover content on the web. Previously I was on the advisory board of <a href = "http://www.lockerz.com">Lockerz.com</a>, a social commerce startup that rewards its users for sharing content from across the web. I have a strong business acumen, but study computer science in my free-time. I code mainly in front-end languages like JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and others. I'm also somewhat of a nomad, so it's hard to catch me in one place for very long. 
</p>
