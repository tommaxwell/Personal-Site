<h1> Personal Site Template </h1>


<p> This project is a simple personal website made in HTML and CSS. Feel free to copy it and use it as your own,
but remember to change the link destinations, picture, and main paragraph. The font I used on my deployment is <a href
= "http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/">Klavika</a>, so you'll have to purchase it or use your own. </p>

<b>Here's the template in action: http://www.tommaxwell.me</b>

<b>Update: October 25, 2012 -</b> I've fixed compatibility issues with the Opera browser, so the template should look almost exactly the same across all of the major browsers, save for some differences in things like font-weight and margins.
